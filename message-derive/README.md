# mork-message-derive

Apparently you need to have procedural macros in another crate, so this is anoter crate.
*[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56713877/why-do-proc-macros-have-to-be-defined-in-proc-macro-crate)
is a thread about this on stackoverflow*

This has derive macros for the crate mork. [mork on github](https://github.com/dojje/mork). [mork on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mork).

Those macros are used for serialising and deserialising messages from and to byte arrays to be sent over internet.
